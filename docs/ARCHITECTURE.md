## Network map (split-horizon)

- Host Browser → `localhost:3000` → Gitea container
- Host Browser → `localhost:8000` → Woodpecker server
- Host Browser → `localhost:8080` → Argo CD server
- Woodpecker Agent → `gitea:3000` (internal clone URL)
- Argo CD → `gitea:3000` (internal GitOps source)
- CI push → `localhost:5000` (public registry endpoint)
- k3d pulls → `registry:5000` (internal registry via `registries.yaml` generated by k3d)

## Delivery flow
1. Developer pushes code to Gitea.
2. Woodpecker pipeline runs tests, builds, scans with Trivy, and pushes the image to the local registry.
3. Pipeline updates GitOps manifests with the new image tag (`[skip ci]` commit) and pushes back to Gitea.
4. Argo CD watches the GitOps path and reconciles the cluster state.
5. The Hello API is exposed through the k3d load balancer on port 8080, supporting `/`, `/healthz`, and `/version` endpoints.
